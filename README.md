# hidden-gems-movies

A mini-project exploring movies of the IMDB dataset that have high ratings but low popularity

## Motivation
As a movie lover, I am always on the lookout for high-quality independent movies. For this project, my goal is to find the “hidden gems” in the IMDB movie dataset. 
These are defined as movies with a low number of user ratings (which implies they are not well-known, likely because they weren’t released at large cinema chains and only reached a limited audience), but a high average rating. 
Furthermore, I would also like to find out the proportion of each genre in these titles (using a pie chart) - my hypothesis is Romance movies will take up the largest proportion, but I would like to test that.

Insights from this study would be valuable for movie industry professionals for finding good movie directors and small-scale productions to invest in, for film festival organizers and independent cinemas to expand their line-ups by-genre, and also for independent movie fans like me!
 
## Research Questions
* What are the highly-rated but unpopular “hidden gems” titles from the IMDB movie dataset?
* Among these movies, what proportion does each genre take up?
  * Is Romance indeed the most numerous category of these movies?
  * What is the highest-rated, low-popularity Comedy title?

## Findings

The research questions I set out to explore where answered, since I found the 313 titles that are highly rated (mean rating less than 4.0) and are unpopular (number of ratings fewer than the mean number of ratings, 747). 
I also found the proportion taken up by each genre, and the pie chart shows Drama and Comedy are the two genres with the most titles, with Romance coming third instead of first.
A possible improvement would be to adjust the filter requirements so that more titles are included, as well as looking at tags in addition to genres of movies. 
I am also interested in doing a more thorough analysis on a larger dataset, with more internaitonal titles.
